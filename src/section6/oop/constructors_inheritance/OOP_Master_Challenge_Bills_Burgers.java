Basic Hamburger:
- bread roll type
- meat   (base price)
- 4 additional additions (lettuce, tomato, carrot, etc) customer can select to add (separately priced)


Two extra varieties of burgers:

Healthy Burger
- brown rye bread roll
- 2 additional items, 6 in total.

Deluxe burger
- comes with chips and drinks as additions, and no extra additions are allowed.

All 3 types should have a method to display at all times the base price plus all additions.
Subclasses -> add totals to the final price.
